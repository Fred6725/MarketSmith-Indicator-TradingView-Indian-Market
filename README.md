# MarketSmith-Indicator-TradingView-Indian-Market
Hello everyone,

Note for the Indian version or every other indices:
I have modified the RS Rating part in order as follow;
Originally the RS Rating script is made of 3 parts:
- Stock against % of US stocks above 200,150,100,50 & 20 SMA Daily
- Stock Performance
- Stock Performance divided by the reference ticker

Here I removed the part where stock is compared to % of stocks above SMA because there is no equivalent for other indices.
Only the last two methods remain, you can now change the comparative ticker and calculation should be similar.
/!\ I didn't calibrate the result on this version, please take a good look at the results before adopting the script! /!\

Otherwise:
I have made these scripts available for you to replicate visually and functionally MarketSmith graphs on a free subscription plan on TradingView.

To import them, just copy the entire code text and go on your TradingView graph.
Clique on 'Pine Editor' at the bottom left, then select 'Open' -> 'Indicator' and paste the code here. You can save it and find it on "My scripts".

If you appreciate my 200+ hours work for you and want to support me to bring you more features like this (eg: pattern recognition), feel free to buy me a coffee, it will be much appreciated :)
